We tried to apply traditional ML methods to predict the sign of the next day BTC course and the sign of the alpha value.

KNN, SVM, and Logistic Regression were applied and mixed results were achieved. This showed that different features have prediction power, but are limited.

The results are not included in the thesis but could be used as a more complex benchmark. For example, define a threshold value for the prediction probability (e.g. 0,75) and perform a 100% buy action if the probability for a next day positive return is predicted.
