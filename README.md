# Code for the Master Thesis  "A Multimodal Signal Framework for Trading Cryptocurrencies with Reinforcement Learning"

# The structure of the code follows the structure of the thesis:
# Part 2: collects all Twitter data and preprocesses the ticker and news set
# Part 3: covers the sentiment analysis by analysis multiple models and then applying the best performing BERTweet model (aka finiteautomata_sentiment) to all Tweet collected in 2.
# Part 4: Feature engineering where all features for the the different categories are calculated
# Part 5: Analysis over all data by plotting multiple graphs
# Part 6: Application of simple ML techniques (SVM; KNN, LogReg). This part is not covered in the Thesis
# Part 7: Reinforcement Learning with PPO.
